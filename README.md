The Rift
=======

###About

So, it's a ModJam mod! Made by TheMike and Briman, The Rift aims to be a complete replacement for The End, while still keeping some vanilla aspects. Our ModJam work is a small sliver of what the mod will be, mostly due to timing issues. Raise a dragon, watch a forest light up at night, grow new berries and crops, and more!

###Building

Dosen't require any external libs, so you should be fine using MCP's build system.

###Contributing

Want to add that really neat dragon you made? Feel a texture is out of place? Well, it's open source. So, submit a pull request, and we'll check it out.

###Licence

BSD, 3 cause.
